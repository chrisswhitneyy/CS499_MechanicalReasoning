# CS499 Mechanical Reasoning
-All team project code for Fall 2016 mechincal reasoning course. 
## Project 1: 
A partial implementation of the formal proof described by Painter and McCarthy using Coq. The goal of McCarthy was to obtain machine-checked proofs of correctness for compilers. This work is not machine-checked but, unlike most pen-and-paper work, it is quite detailed.
